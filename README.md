## Usage

### Installation

[repository](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/contextpack):

``` sh
$ pip install contextpack
```

## How to use

``` python
from contextpack import *
```

TLDR: if you want to get llm-friendly context on the FastHTML library,
do this:

``` python
fh_llm = ctx_fasthtml.fasthtml_llms_ctx.get()
fh_llm[:100]
```

    'Things to remember when writing FastHTML apps: \\- Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI,'

In short, this is how you use it:

1.  From contextpack.core import \*
2.  Use `ctx_<TAB>` to see all available topics and pick one
3.  Use `.<TAB>` to see all subtopics, which are the contexts you might
    choose
4.  Add `.get()` to pull the context itself

For example:

``` python
ctx_fastlite_sqlutils
```

    doc: LLM contexts on fastlite-sqlutils
    sub-topics: ['fastlite_core', 'fastlite_index', 'sqlite_utils_docs']

``` python
fc_llm = ctx_fastlite_sqlutils.fastlite_core.get()
fc_llm[:100]
```

    '# Source  ## Metadata ``` python from IPython.display import Markdown from fastcore.test import test'

You can also learn a little about topics and subtopics from their repr:

``` python
ctx_fastlite_sqlutils
```

    doc: LLM contexts on fastlite-sqlutils
    sub-topics: ['fastlite_core', 'fastlite_index', 'sqlite_utils_docs']

You can also learn a little about topics and subtopics from their repr:

``` python
ctx_fastlite_sqlutils.fastlite_core
```
